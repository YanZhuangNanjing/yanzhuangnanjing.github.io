I am a postdoctoral research fellow from Imaging Biomarkers and Computer-Aided Diagnosis Laboratory at NIH Clinical Center. My research is in the area of medical imaging analysis, focusing on the development of large-scale datasets and innovative computational tools to enhance clinical efficiency and streamline clinical workflows in radiology.

<!---
My research focuses on medical image analysis, medical computer vision, and mobile health, particularly in the development of AI (deep learning) models for medical image segmentation and computer-aided diagnosis.

I am a postdoctoral research fellow from Imaging Biomarkers and Computer-Aided Diagnosis Laboratory at NIH Clinical Center. My research focuses on large-scale medical imaging analysis and medical computer vision. Specifically, I am interested in medical image segmentation and classification in the few-sample setting, i.e., few-shot learning and domain adaptation.

I got my PhD from Imaging and Data Science Lab under Prof. Gustavo Rohde guidance at University of Virginia. During my PhD training, I did a research internship with cardiovascular imaging team at Siemens Healthineers, Princeton, NJ. Previously, I was a research associate @ ESC Lab under Prof. Wenyao Xu guidance from 2014-2015, University at Buffalo. I got my M.S. degree from University at Buffalo.
