I am a faculty instructor at <a href="https://icahn.mssm.edu/about/departments-offices/radiology" target="_blank">the Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology</a> and <a href="https://icahn.mssm.edu/about/departments-offices/ai-human-health" target="_blank">the Windreich Department of Artificial Intelligence and Human Health</a> at <a href="https://icahn.mssm.edu/" target="_blank">Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai</a>. Previously I was a postdoctoral research fellow at the Imaging Biomarkers and Computer-Aided Diagnosis Laboratory under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cc.nih.gov/meet-our-doctors/rsummers" target="_blank">Dr. Ronald Summers</a> at <a href="https://www.cc.nih.gov/" target="_blank">NIH Clinical Center</a>. I got my PhD under the supervision of <a href="https://imagedatascience.com" target="_blank">Dr. Gustavo Rohde</a> from <a href="https://www.virginia.edu/" target="_blank">University of Virginia</a>. 

My research is medical imaging analysis, focusing on the development of large-scale datasets and innovative computational tools for radiology.

<!---
My research focuses on medical image analysis, medical computer vision, and mobile health, particularly in the development of AI (deep learning) models for medical image segmentation and computer-aided diagnosis.

I am a postdoctoral research fellow from Imaging Biomarkers and Computer-Aided Diagnosis Laboratory at NIH Clinical Center. My research focuses on large-scale medical imaging analysis and medical computer vision. Specifically, I am interested in medical image segmentation and classification in the few-sample setting, i.e., few-shot learning and domain adaptation.

I got my PhD from Imaging and Data Science Lab under Prof. Gustavo Rohde guidance at University of Virginia. During my PhD training, I did a research internship with cardiovascular imaging team at Siemens Healthineers, Princeton, NJ. Previously, I was a research associate @ ESC Lab under Prof. Wenyao Xu guidance from 2014-2015, University at Buffalo. I got my M.S. degree from University at Buffalo.
